# Optimization Recommendations for EbayMMO

## 1. Remove console.log statements in production

- There are numerous console.log statements throughout the codebase that should be removed in production
- While there's a configuration in next.config.ts to remove console.log statements in production, it's better to clean them up manually
- Files with console.log statements:
    - src/components/ProductStore/index.tsx
    - src/contexts/WishlistContext.tsx
    - src/components/AuthHandler.tsx
    - src/components/BaseUI/Section/ContactSection.tsx
    - src/components/BaseUI/Section/CategorySection.tsx
    - src/components/BaseUI/Editor/ConvertEditorJS.tsx
    - src/components/PopupAddProduct/PopupAddProduct.tsx
    - src/app/(default)/2fa/page.tsx
    - src/app/(default)/products/[product]/page.tsx
    - src/app/(default)/\_components/HeaderMenuDropdown.tsx
    - src/app/(default)/contacts/page.tsx
    - src/app/(default)/user-details/[id]/page.tsx
    - src/app/(account)/user/withdrawal-history/page.tsx
    - src/app/(auth)/reset-password/page.tsx
    - src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx
    - src/app/(account)/user/transaction-history/page.tsx
    - src/app/(account)/user/order-managements/page.tsx
    - src/app/(account)/seller/store-management/page.tsx
    - src/hooks/useUploadAvatar.ts
    - src/hooks/useFilter.ts

## 2. Optimize image loading

- Ensure all images use the Next.js Image component with proper width and height attributes
- Add priority attribute to above-the-fold images
- Implement proper image sizes for responsive design
- Consider using next/image's quality attribute to balance quality and performance
- Implement proper loading strategies (eager for above-the-fold, lazy for below-the-fold)
- Consider using WebP or AVIF formats for better compression

## 3. Implement proper data fetching strategies

- Use appropriate Apollo Client fetchPolicy based on the data needs
- Some components are using 'network-only' when 'cache-and-network' might be more efficient
- Implement proper pagination with cursor-based pagination where appropriate
- Consider implementing ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration) for semi-static data
- Use SWR or React Query for data that needs to be frequently updated
- Implement proper error handling and retry mechanisms for failed requests

## 4. Memoize expensive calculations

- More components could benefit from useMemo and useCallback
- Some components are already using useMemo but could be optimized further
- Identify and memoize expensive calculations in components like:
    - src/components/FavouriteStore/FavouriteStore.tsx
    - src/app/(default)/user-details/[id]/page.tsx
    - src/app/(default)/users/(user)/order-management/OrderManagementContent.tsx
    - src/contexts/WishlistContext.tsx
    - src/app/(default)/favorite-stores/page.tsx
    - src/app/(account)/user/reseller-history/page.tsx

## 5. Implement code splitting and lazy loading

- Large components should be lazy loaded
- Consider using dynamic imports for components that aren't needed immediately
- Split the bundle into smaller chunks to improve initial load time
- Implement route-based code splitting
- Consider using React.lazy and Suspense for component-level code splitting

## 6. Optimize React component rendering

- Implement React.memo for pure components
- Use useCallback for event handlers passed to child components
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders by properly structuring component hierarchy
- Use the React DevTools Profiler to identify components that re-render unnecessarily
- Consider using the useTransition hook for non-urgent state updates

## 7. Remove unused imports and dependencies

- There are several unused imports that could be cleaned up
- Consider using a tool like depcheck to identify unused dependencies
- Remove duplicate dependencies
- Update dependencies to their latest versions for better performance and security

## 8. Implement proper error handling and loading states

- Some components have inconsistent error handling
- Implement skeleton loaders consistently across the application
- Use error boundaries to catch and handle errors gracefully
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed API calls
- Provide meaningful error messages to users

## 9. Optimize API calls

- Batch related API calls where possible
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider using GraphQL batching and caching
- Implement debouncing for search inputs and other frequently changing inputs
- Use pagination and infinite scrolling for large data sets

## 10. Implement proper state management

- Consider using React Context or Redux more efficiently
- Avoid prop drilling by using context where appropriate
- Split large reducers into smaller, more manageable ones
- Implement proper state normalization
- Consider using Redux Toolkit for simpler Redux setup

## 11. Optimize SessionProvider refetchInterval

- In src/app/(default)/layout.tsx, the SessionProvider has a refetchInterval of 5 minutes
- Consider if this interval can be increased to reduce unnecessary API calls
- Implement a more intelligent refetch strategy based on user activity

## 12. Optimize CSS and styling

- Remove unused CSS
- Consider using CSS-in-JS solutions like styled-components or emotion for better tree-shaking
- Implement critical CSS for faster initial rendering
- Minimize the use of large CSS frameworks
- Use CSS variables for better maintainability

## 13. Implement proper caching

- Implement proper HTTP caching headers
- Use service workers for offline support and caching
- Implement Redis or other caching solutions for backend data
- Use localStorage or IndexedDB for client-side caching where appropriate

## 14. Optimize third-party libraries

- Audit and minimize third-party dependencies
- Consider using smaller alternatives for large libraries
- Implement proper tree-shaking to remove unused code
- Load non-critical third-party scripts asynchronously

## 15. Implement performance monitoring

- Set up performance monitoring tools like Lighthouse CI
- Implement real user monitoring (RUM)
- Set up alerts for performance regressions
- Regularly audit and optimize the application

## 16. Optimize for Core Web Vitals

- Focus on improving LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
- Minimize CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)
- Improve FID (First Input Delay) and INP (Interaction to Next Paint)
- Implement proper font loading strategies

## 17. Implement proper SEO

- Ensure all pages have proper meta tags
- Implement structured data where appropriate
- Ensure proper accessibility for better SEO
- Implement proper canonical URLs

## 18. Optimize for mobile

- Ensure the application is fully responsive
- Implement touch-friendly UI elements
- Optimize for mobile network conditions
- Consider implementing a Progressive Web App (PWA)

## 19. Implement proper security measures

- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Sanitize user inputs
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Keep dependencies updated to avoid security vulnerabilities

## 20. Optimize build process

- Implement proper code splitting in the build process
- Minimize the use of polyfills
- Implement proper tree-shaking
- Consider using modern JavaScript features with proper fallbacks
